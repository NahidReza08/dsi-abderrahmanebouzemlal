### üß† What I Learned

This project gave me hands-on experience with **dark theme design** and optimizing layouts using **Tailwind 4**‚Äôs new color system and responsive features.  
I also practiced structuring reusable UI sections such as testimonials, hero sections, and call-to-action cards.

Example: creating a dark card component with hover effects

```html
<div class="bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl hover:bg-slate-700 transition">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Secure file storage</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
    Store your most important files in one secure location. Access them anywhere, anytime.
  </p>
</div>
